# Presentation: Spread the JAM

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/5932f3fc-4c0a-4ec0-a80e-d347a85334d1/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/spread-the-jam/deploys)

The JAMstack is revolutionizing the way we think about our workflow by providing a simpler developer experience, better performance, lower cost, and greater scalability. Learn more about this front end-focused approach to building sites and apps, and get a hands-on demo where we will:

- set up a Gatsby site with a contact form
- deploy the site to Netlify
- set up Netlify Forms to capture and manage form entries (all without a web server!)
