# Presentation: Spread the JAM

The JAMstack is revolutionizing the way we think about our workflow by providing a simpler developer experience, better performance, lower cost, and greater scalability. Learn more about this front end-focused approach to building sites and apps, and get a hands-on demo where we will:

- set up a Gatsby site with a contact form
- deploy the site to Netlify
- set up Netlify Forms to capture and manage form entries (all without a web server!)
