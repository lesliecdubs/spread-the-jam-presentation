# Spreading the Jam: Getting started with the Jamstack using Gatsby and Netlify Forms

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/5932f3fc-4c0a-4ec0-a80e-d347a85334d1/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/spread-the-jam/deploys)

The Jamstack is revolutionizing the way we think about our development workflows. With a single push to git, we can deploy our sites and apps with an expectation that they will perform better, scale with ease, and cost less.

Learn more about this front end-focused approach to building sites and apps, and get a hands-on demo where we will:

- set up a Gatsby site with a contact form
- deploy the site to Netlify
- set up Netlify Forms to capture and manage form entries (all without a writing server side code!)
