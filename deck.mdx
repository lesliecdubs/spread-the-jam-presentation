# Spreading the JAM

Getting started with the JAMstack<br /> using Gatsby and Netlify Forms

<Notes>
  <p>So excited to be here with you (remotely) today!</p>
  <p>
    Over the next half hour, we'll look at getting started with the JAMstack and
    how you can set up a static site that collects form responses - without any
    server side code - using Gatsby and Netlify Forms.
  </p>
  <p>Whoa, that's a lot of buzzwords!</p>
  <p>
    Some of them may sound familiar, especially if you were at Sarah Drasner's
    workshop yesterday. I hope this talk will be a useful refresher.
  </p>
  <p>But before we dig in, a little about me...</p>

Front end engineer at Netlify

@lesliecdubs

<Notes>
  <h2>Intro + Netlify</h2>
  <p>My name is LCW</p>
  <p>I work remotely from Dallas as a FE engineer at Netlify</p>
  <p>
    Netlify is a platform that helps you build fast, modern websites on the
    JAMstack, then helps you host them
  </p>
  <p>I work on the front end of the React app that powers Netlify</p>
  <p>We deploy Netlify on Netlify (so meta!)</p>
  <hr />
  <h2>Agency life</h2>
  <p>
    Started my dev career in NYC, working at digital agencies on sites for
    clients like Nintendo and Jerry Seinfeld
  </p>
  <p>
    I was used to having to bug backend engineers to get my front end views
    wired up to the back end properly
  </p>
  <p>
    And then I had to bother the DevOps team to prepare a staging environment
  </p>
  <p>It seemed like there should be a be a better way. Enter the JAMstack!</p>
  <p>
    As a FE dev, this new approach to building sites gave me superpowers, and
    allowed me to ignore all that other stuff and focus on building impressive
    front end experiences
  </p>
  <hr />
  <p>Btw, my handle is @lesliecdubs, find me on Twitter + GitHub</p>

<Notes>
  <p>
    <strong>Javascript:</strong> client-side functionality (often via a
    framework like React or Vue, or vanilla JS / jQuery)
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>API (Application Programming Interface):</strong> JAMstack sites use
    APIs to integrate data and other dynamic information. They often serve this
    data to your front end through JSON
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Markup:</strong> HTML / presentation layer
  </p>
  <hr />
  <p>So what does that mean? The JAMstack is a decoupled approach to web dev</p>
  <p>"Separation of concerns" for front + back end</p>
  <p>
    Front end has its own repo (JS + Markup), connects to "back end" via APIs
  </p>
  <p>
    Leverage microservices + serverless functions to build more complex +
    dynamic web apps
  </p>
  <p>
    The name was coined bc "static site" doesn't do it justice (comment systems,
    web forms, ecommerce...)
  </p>
  <hr />
  <p>
    JAMstack as a term has been around for 3 or 4 years, though the idea
    predates that
  </p>
  <p>Syntax FM: "BYOF - bring your own front end"</p>

<Notes>
  <h2>Traditional workflow</h2>
  <p>Fetch data at runtime</p>
  <p>
    When a user loads a page in their browser, traditional sites will send a
    request to be processed by a database server
  </p>
  <p>
    Once that request is filled, the web server will stitch the data response
    together with HTML to assemble a dynamic view
  </p>
  <p>Finally, that page will get served to the client (browser)</p>
  <p>
    Other steps: CDN layer helps with caching, and probably load balancer to
    help distribute traffic to the right servers
  </p>
  <p>Creates a slower experience for users with multiple points of failure</p>
  <hr />
  <h2>JAMstack workflow</h2>
  <p>Fetch data at build time</p>
  <p>
    Content may live in a CMS, markdown files in the repo, or pulled in via APIs
  </p>
  <p>
    Instead of the user waiting for the server to dynamically render their
    views, the JAMstack offloads that wait time onto the developer during a
    build step
  </p>
  <p>
    Lucky for us, that build step can be automated w continuous integration &
    delivery
  </p>
  <p>
    When the page loads in the browser, the request goes directly to a CDN that
    has a pre-rendered view of that site
  </p>
  <p>Which gets delievered back to the client</p>

# Why <span className="highlight">JAM</span>stack?

<ul>
  <Appear>
    <li>‚ö°Ô∏è Blazing fast performance</li>
    <li>ü§ë Cheaper + easier scaling</li>
    <li>üö® Fewer security risks</li>
    <li>üë©üèª‚Äçüíª Better developer experience</li>
    <li>‚ú® Give front end developers superpowers</li>
  </Appear>
</ul>

<Notes>
  <p>
    Given what we now know about how the JAMstack works, it's clear that one the
    biggest advantages of this architure is <strong>performance:</strong> We
    serve pre-built markup and assets over a CDN (Content Delivery Network) so
    our sites load really, really fast (and we get better Lighthouse scores)
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Scalability:</strong> Cheaper to host. No server maintenance + sites
    can scale without worry (CDN compensates for more visitors).
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Security:</strong> No need to worry about server or db
    vulnerabilities
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>DX:</strong> Front end focused, allows quicker dev with modern tools
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Front end:</strong> Build full-stack apps with only JS knowledge +
    leverage existing microservices for deeper functionality
  </p>

# What the <span className="highlight">JAM</span>stack _isn‚Äôt_

Tight coupling between client and server:

    />

    />
    <li>server-side rendered SPA</li>
    <li>monolithic server-run web app</li>
  </Appear>
</ul>

<Notes>
  <p>
    It can be helpful to understand what a particular architure is by exploring
    what it is not.
  </p>
  <hr />
  <p>
    1. A JAMstack site wouldn't be built with a server-side CMS using a built-in
    theme (traditional WP, Drupal, Joomla, or Squarespace)
  </p>
  <p>
    (unless you are using a REST API to bring content stored in one of those
    places into a decoupled front end)
  </p>
  <hr />
  <p>
    2. A JAMstack site isn't a single page app that uses isomorphic rendering to
    build views on the server at runtime. JAMstack sites fetch data at build
    time, and can instead use progressive enhancement to bring interactivity
    into the browser at runtime
  </p>
  <hr />
  <p>
    3. And finally, we have monolithic web apps that rely on Ruby or other
    backend languages
  </p>
  <hr />
  <h2>When not to use JAMstack</h2>
  <p>Massive site (millions of pages) due to time needed for build step</p>
  <p>
    However, the tools that we use to build JAMstack sites can help keep build
    times in check
  </p>
  <p>
    If you need hand-written dynamic features like comments, e-commerce, etc,
    and can't use an existing service like Disqus, Stripe, Netlify forms, etc
  </p>
  <p>So what are the ingredients of a JAMstack site?</p>

  <h2>Version control</h2>
</Appear>

<Notes>
  <h2>Static site generator</h2>
  <p>
    First, we rely on static site generators to build all of the pages of our
    websites, when there are changes to the site
  </p>
  <p>
    The word "static" can be a little misleading; we are not talking a static or
    unchanging user experience, but about static architecture (host statically)
  </p>
  <p>SSGs can be Javascript-based, but dont have to be</p>
  <hr />
  <h2>Headless CMS</h2>
  <p>
    The next ingredient is often a CMS to help manage the dynamic, changing
    content on our site
  </p>
  <p>
    The field of headless CMSes has exploded recently, so there are a lot of
    options to choose from based on your needs
  </p>
  <p>Open source options - you can submit PRs, community-driven</p>
  <p>
    Commercial options - many offer free tier but require payment for heavier
    usage, well funded, backed by full-time team
  </p>
  <hr />
  <h2>Version control</h2>
  <p>
    Best practice to use Git (usually either GitHub, GitLab or Bitbucket) for
    handling version control
  </p>

<Notes>
  <p>
    Whew, this slide is overwhelming! but it shows how big the ecosystem really
    is
  </p>
  <p>
    You'll always want some kind of presentation layer; perhaps React or Vue, or
    a static site generator like Jekyll or Hugo, or a UI library or toolkit
  </p>
  <p>
    If you need dynamic data, you'll want to wire in an API of some kind. This
    could include a CMS or a utility API
  </p>
  <p>Ideally you're using version control and storing your code in Git</p>
  <p>And then you'll need a host. My favorite is Netlify.</p>
  <p>So, if you put all of these ingredients together, what do you get?</p>

    we've chosen for this project

# Why Gatsby?

A ‚Äústatic site generator‚Äù based on React

<ul>
  <Appear>
    <li>üõ† Build your site in React</li>
    <li>üìÇ GraphQL data layer</li>
    <li>üîå Rich plugin ecosystem</li>
    <li>üìñ Good documentation + starters</li>
    <li>‚ö°Ô∏è Emphasis on performance + accessibility</li>
  </Appear>
</ul>

<Notes>
  <p>
    I chose Gatsby for this demo bc I work in React every day, but we could have
    used any static site generator for this example
  </p>
  <p>
    At build time, Gatsby creates an internal GraphQL server of all your data
    (wherever it may be stored - Markdown, JSON, a CMS, third party API, etc).
    All your data is queried at build time from your React components in a
    consistent way
  </p>
  <p>
    Gatsby ecosystem is rich; data source plugins provide for an easy connection
    to APIs
  </p>
  <p>
    Gatsby has clear documentation + starters, which are Gatsby sites that are
    preconfigured for different use cases to give you a head start for your
    project
  </p>
  <p>Built with performance and accessibility in mind</p>
  <p>
    (no more clicks) So, assuming we've set up a Gatsby site, what do we do with
    it?
  </p>
  <p>
    The JAMstack architecture would tell us that we want to host it statically,
    right? That's where Netlify comes in...

# Why Netlify?

A ‚Äústatic site‚Äù hosting provider leveraging all the benefits of the JAMstack, plus:

    <li>‚úÖ Automated builds</li>
    <li>üòÖ Atomic deploys with one-click rollback</li>
    <li>üåê Custom domains</li>

    <li>‚öôÔ∏è Simple setup</li>
    <li>üÜì Free starter team</li>
  </Appear>
</ul>

<Notes>
  <p>Netlify helps you build and manage JAMstack projects.</p>
  <p>
    It offers automated builds with continous deployment from your Git provider
  </p>
  <p>Configure Netlify to build + deploy when you push to git</p>
  <p>
    Set up webhooks to trigger deploys based on an action elsewhere (e.g.,
    content update in Contentful)
  </p>
  <hr />
  <p>Netlify's deploys are atomic = versions your content by fingerprinting</p>
  <p>
    Instead of pushing individual files (FTP), Netlify creates new deploy object
  </p>
  <p>
    Compares new deploy with existing deploy and determines what files have
    changed
  </p>
  <p>
    Allows for one-click rollback - so you can make an older deploy live
    instantly
  </p>
  <hr />
  <p>
    Netlify sites come with their own customizable URL, your-site.netlify.com
  </p>
  <p>Or buy a custom domain through Netlify or another domain provider</p>
  <hr />
  <p>Free HTTPS comes out of the box</p>
  <hr />
  <p>Simple setup</p>
  <p>
    Free team with flexible pricing tiers and add-ons if you need more team
    members, bandwidth, guaranteed support, etc

<Notes>
  <p>
    So, now that we're familiar with the tools we're going to use, let's get
    started building a portfolio site in Gatsby with a contact form that will
    store form responses in Netlify
  </p>

      {
        lines: [5],
        notes: "Start dev server"
      }
    ]}
  />
</div>

<Notes>
  <p>
    To start, we would open up the terminal and install the Gatsby command line
    tools (follow code)
  </p>
  <p>Now, let's see what our local Gatsby starter looks like</p>
</Notes>

export default LayoutDark;

        src='./videos/gatsby-starter-forty.mov'
      />
    `
  }}
/>

<Notes>
  <p>This is a pretty slick looking starter</p>
  <p>
    We're going to focus in on this existing contact form, and hook it up to
    capture leads from people who visit our site
  </p>
  <p>
    To do that, we'll want to open up our favorite code editor and bring up the
    Gatsby code in the portfolio directory we just created
  </p>
</Notes>

<div style={{ lineHeight: "1.5" }}>
  <CodeSurfer

        notes: "Add a hidden input field with the form name"
      }
    ]}
  />
</div>

<Notes>
  <p>
    Open the Contact.js file of the Gatsby starter so we can hook it up to
    Netlify
  </p>
  <p>
    Once the site is deployed, Netlify's post-processing bots are going to look
    for `netlify` attributes on the form in order to capture it
  </p>
  <p>
    These bots only know how to parse HTML, so we have to give them a little
    help to make sure they can detect forms rendered with Javascript (walk
    through code)
  </p>
  <p>
    Now our site is ready to be deployed. Before we do that, let's make sure
    we've hooked our local code up to a GitHub repository
  </p>

<Notes>
  <p>
    Now we can test the form live on our Netlify site by visiting
    https://netlify-gatsby-form-example.netlify.com/
  </p>
  <p>Fill out the form if you want</p>
  <p>To see form responses, we can visit the Netlify dashboard</p>
  <p>Netlify is essentially acting as our database to hold the form entries</p>
  <p>
    You can als set up email notifications so you know when a user submits your
    form
  </p>
  <p>Let's try it out!</p>

<Notes>
  <p>First, we'll visit the site that we deployed on Netlify</p>
  <p>And now we're going to try filling out our form</p>
  <p>Success! Let's make sure Netlify captured our form entry</p>

<Notes>
  <p>We would want to visit our Netlify dashboard</p>
  <p>Click into the site and then go to "Forms"</p>
  <p>There's our form, with the name we set earlier</p>
  <p>And there's our entry!</p>
  <p>
    If this site had been live for a while, we could also use this toggle to see
    any spam entries that Netlify filtered out for us

# The <span className="highlight">JAM</span>stack difference

<ul>
  <li>‚ö°Ô∏è Blazing fast performance</li>
  <li>ü§ë Cheaper + easier scaling</li>
  <li>üö® Fewer security risks</li>
  <li>üë©üèª‚Äçüíª Better developer experience</li>
  <li>‚ú® Give front end developers superpowers</li>
</ul>

<Notes>
  <p>So why does all this matter again?</p>
  <p>JAMstack doesn't mean you're stuck with a "static," unchanging site</p>
  <p>
    It means you're choosing all of these advantages - performance, scaling, a
    better dev experience - by choosing a static architecture and deciding to
    host statically
  </p>
