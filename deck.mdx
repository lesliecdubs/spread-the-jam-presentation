# Spreading the JAM

Getting started with the JAMstack<br /> using Gatsby and Netlify Forms

<Notes>
  <p>Lots of buzzwords!</p>
  <p>JAMstack, Gatsby, Netlify... let's break it down.</p>
  <p>But first, a little about me...</p>

<Notes>
  <p>Born in Austin -> college in Denver -> 6 months in Aus</p>
  <p>NYC for 6 years, first dev job at an ad agency</p>
  <p>That's where I first started building with the JAMstack</p>
  <p>Moved to Dallas 2.5 years ago, working remote</p>
  <p>Hired as a front end engineer at Netlify 6 months ago</p>
  <p>
    I primarily work on app.netlify.com - which is a React front end - building
    new features and squashing bugs

<Notes>
  <p>Built on the idea of a decoupled or headless approach</p>
  <p>"Separation of concerns" for front + back end</p>
  <p>Front end will live in its own repository and connect to back end via APIs</p>
  <p>Stop spending time configuring and building a new back end for every project</p>
  <p>Leverage microservices + serverless functions to build web apps</p>

# Why JAMstack

- Better performance
- Cheaper, easier scaling
- Higher security
- Better developer experience
- Gives superpowers to front end developers ("full stack front end")

---

# What the JAMstack isn't

- A site built with a server-side CMS using a built-in theme
  - Wordpress, Drupal, Joomla, Squarespace...
  - (unless you have access to REST API to bring in content to a decoupled front end)
- A single page app that uses isomorphic rendering to build views on the server at runtime
- A monolithic server-run web app that relies on Ruby, Node, or another backend languages

---

# JAMstack ecosystem

<Appear>
  - "Static" site generator (your code)
    - Jekyll, Next, Hugo, Gatsby, React Static, Vuepress, Middleman...
    - staticgen.com
  - Headless CMS or Markdown or Databases (your content)
    - Open source: Strapi, Netlify CMS, Ghost, WordPress...
    - Commercial: Sanity, Scrivito, Contentful, Cosmic JS, DatoCMS, Forestry...
    - headlesscms.org 
</Appear>

# JAMstack best practices

<Appear>
  - Modern build tools
  - Continuous deployment from git
  - Atomic deploys 
  - One-click rollback
  - Instant cache invalidation
</Appear>

---

# So... what does this have to do with React?

- Remember "modern build tools"?
- BYOF: Write your app in React Static, Gatsby, etc
- The SSG will transform it into a directory with a single hTML file and static assets
- The folder is served from your hosting provider as a "static site"
- but with all the reactivity we get from React

---

# Building forms on the JAMstack

- A traditional form would require a server to store entries in a database 
- But the JAMstack offers a better way

---

# All about Netlify

- Static web hosting
- Continuous deployment from GitHub, GitLab & Bitbucket
- Automatic HTTPS
- Custom domains
- One-click rollbacks
- Deploy previews for every commit and/or branch (you choose!)
- Add-ons: Functions, Identity, Large Media, and...
- Forms!!!

# Let's get coding

- Gatsby example
