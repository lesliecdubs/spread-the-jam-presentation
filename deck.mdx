# Spreading the Jam

Getting started with the Jamstack<br /> using Gatsby and Netlify Forms

<Notes>
  <p>So excited to be here with you (remotely) today!</p>
  <p>
    Over the next half hour, we'll look at getting started with the Jamstack and
    how you can set up a static site that collects form responses - without any
    server side code - using Gatsby and Netlify Forms.
  </p>
  <p>Whoa, that's a lot of buzzwords! Don't worry, we'll cover what they mean.</p>
  <p>But before we dig in, a little about me...</p>

<Notes>
  <h2>Intro + Netlify</h2>
  <p>My name is LCW</p>
  <p>I work remotely from Dallas as a FE engineer at Netlify</p>
  <p>
    Netlify is a platform that helps you build fast, modern websites on the
    Jamstack, then helps you host them
  </p>
  <hr />
  <h2>Agency life</h2>
  <p>
    Started my dev career in NYC, working at digital agencies on sites for
    clients like Nintendo and Jerry Seinfeld
  </p>
  <p>
    I was used to having to bug backend engineers to get my frontend views
    wired up to the back end properly
  </p>
  <p>
    And then I had to bother the DevOps team to prepare a staging environment
  </p>
  <p>It seemed like there should be a be a better way. Enter the Jamstack!</p>
  <p>
    As a FE dev, this new approach to building sites let me focus on building impressive
    frontend experiences, and opened up the world of serverless - where I can write backend functionality - all in JS, without writing backend code.
  </p>

<Notes>
  <p>
    Jamstack is an architecture more than an acronym
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>JS:</strong> client-side functionality (often via a
    framework like React or Vue, or vanilla JS / jQuery)
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>API:</strong> Jamstack sites use APIs to integrate data and 
    other dynamic information. They often serve this
    data to your frontend through JSON.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Markup:</strong> HTML / presentation layer
  </p>
  <hr />
  <p>The Jamstack is a decoupled approach to web dev. "Separation of concerns" for front + back end</p>
  <p>
    Front end has its own repo (JS + Markup), connects to "back end" via APIs
  </p>
  <p>
    Leverage microservices + serverless functions to build more complex +
    dynamic web apps
  </p>
  <p>
    Prebuilt into highly optimized static pages and assets during a build process. 
    Pre-rendering results in sites which can be served directly from a CDN (cheaper, scalable, secure).
  </p>
  <p>
    The "Jamstack" name was coined bc "static site" doesn't do it justice (comment systems,
    web forms, ecommerce...)
  </p>
  <hr />
  <p>
    Jamstack as a term has been around for 5 or 6 years, though the idea
    predates that

<Notes>
  <h2>Traditional workflow</h2>
  <p>Fetch data at runtime</p>
  <p>
    User loads a page in their browser, request is sent off to be processed by a database server
  </p>
  <p>
    Request is filled; web server will stitch the data response together with HTML to assemble a dynamic view
  </p>
  <p>Finally, that page will get served to the client (browser)</p>
  <p>
    Other steps: CDN layer helps with caching, load balancer to help distribute traffic to the right servers
  </p>
  <p>Creates a slower experience for users, with multiple points of failure</p>
  <hr />
  <h2>Jamstack workflow</h2>
  <p>Fetch data at build time</p>
  <p>
    Content may live in a CMS, markdown files in the repo, or pulled in via APIs
  </p>
  <p>
    Instead of user waiting for server to dynamically render their
    views, Jamstack offloads wait time onto the developer during a
    build step
  </p>
  <p>
    Build step can be automated w continuous integration
  </p>
  <p>
    When page loads in the browser, request goes directly to a CDN that
    has a pre-rendered view of that site
  </p>

# Why <span className="highlight">Jam</span>stack?

<ul>
  <Appear>
    <li>‚ö°Ô∏è Blazing fast performance</li>
    <li>ü§ë Cheaper + easier scaling</li>

  </Appear>
</ul>

<Notes>
  <p>
    <strong>Performance:</strong> We
    serve pre-built markup and assets over a CDN (Content Delivery Network) so
    our sites load really, really fast (and we get better Lighthouse scores)
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Scalability:</strong> Cheaper to host. No server maintenance + sites
    can scale without worry (CDN compensates for more visitors).
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Security:</strong> No need to worry about server or db
    vulnerabilities
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>DX:</strong> Front end focused, allows quicker dev with modern tools
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Front end:</strong> Build full-stack apps with only JS knowledge +
    leverage existing microservices for deeper functionality

# What the <span className="highlight">Jam</span>stack _isn‚Äôt_

Tight coupling between client and server:

    />
    <li>monolithic server-run web app</li>
  </Appear>
</ul>

<Notes>
  <p>
    It can be helpful to understand what a particular architure is by exploring
    what it is not.
  </p>
  <hr />
  <p>
    1. wouldn't be built with a server-side CMS with a built-in theme (WP, Drupal, Joomla, or Squarespace)
  </p>
  <p>
    (unless you are using a REST API to bring content stored in one of those
    places into a decoupled frontend)
  </p>
  <hr />
  <p>
    2. isn't a single page app that uses isomorphic rendering to build views on the server at runtime. 
    Jamstack sites fetch data at build time; use progressive enhancement to bring interactivity
    into the browser at runtime
  </p>
  <hr />
  <p>
    3. And finally, we have monolithic web apps that rely on Ruby or other
    backend languages
  </p>
  <hr />
  <h2>When not to use Jamstack</h2>
  <p>
    Massive site (millions of pages) due to time needed for build step (unless Next.js)
  </p>
  <p>
    You have a big team (DevOps), and a project that requirers dynamic, highly variable content
  </p>
  <p>
    If you need hand-written dynamic features like comments, e-commerce, etc,
    and can't use an existing service like Disqus, Stripe, Netlify forms, etc
  </p>
  <p>So what are the ingredients of a Jamstack site?</p>

Choose the benefits of static, but sprinkle in SSR where needed

<Notes>
  <p>
    Some frameworks like Next.js offer dual modes: "server-side rendering" (SSR) & "static site generation" (SSG)
  </p>
  <p>
    Some people might call this "hybrid Jamstack." I would call this "full Jamstack" depending on how the server-side rendering is happening!
  </p>
  <p>
    A "Jamstack way" to do what we typically think of as server-side rendering would involve using serverless functions. We don't have time to cover serverless today...

<Notes>
  <h2>Static site generator</h2>
  <p>
    First, we rely on static site generators to build all of the pages of our
    websites, when there are changes to the site
  </p>
  <p>
    The word "static" can be a little misleading; we are not talking a static or
    unchanging user experience, but about static architecture (host statically)
  </p>
  <p>SSGs can be Javascript-based, but dont have to be</p>
  <hr />
  <h2>Headless CMS</h2>
  <p>
    The next ingredient is often a CMS to help manage the dynamic, changing
    content on our site
  </p>
  <p>
    The field of headless CMSes has exploded recently, so there are a lot of
    options to choose from based on your needs
  </p>
  <p>Open source options - you can submit PRs, community-driven</p>
  <p>
    Commercial options - many offer free tier but require payment for heavier
    usage, well funded, backed by full-time team
  </p>
  <hr />
  <h2>Version control</h2>
  <p>
    Best practice to use Git (usually either GitHub, GitLab or Bitbucket) for
    handling version control
  </p>

<Notes>
  <p>
    Whew, this slide is overwhelming! but it shows how big the ecosystem really
    is
  </p>
  <p>
    You'll always want some kind of presentation layer; perhaps React or Vue, or
    a metaframework built on top of React or Vue like Gatsby or Next.js or Nuxt, 
    or a static site generator like Jekyll or Hugo, or a UI library or toolkit
  </p>
  <p>
    If you need dynamic data, you'll want to wire in an API of some kind. This
    could include a CMS or a utility API like Stripe.
  </p>
  <p>Ideally you're using version control and storing your code in Git</p>
  <p>And then you'll need a host. My favorite is Netlify.</p>
  <p>So, if you put all of these ingredients together, what do you get?</p>

# Why Gatsby?

A ‚Äústatic site generator‚Äù based on React

<ul>
  <Appear>
    <li>üõ† Build your site in React</li>
    <li>üìÇ GraphQL data layer</li>
    <li>üîå Rich plugin ecosystem</li>
    <li>üìñ Good documentation + starters</li>
    <li>‚ö°Ô∏è Emphasis on performance + accessibility</li>
  </Appear>
</ul>

<Notes>
  <p>
    I chose Gatsby for this demo bc I work in React every day, but we could have
    used any static site generator for this example
  </p>
  <p>
    At build time, Gatsby creates an internal GraphQL server of all your data
    (wherever it may be stored - Markdown, JSON, a CMS, third party API, etc).
    All your data is queried at build time from your React components in a
    consistent way
  </p>
  <p>
    Gatsby ecosystem is rich; data source plugins provide for an easy connection
    to APIs
  </p>
  <p>
    Gatsby has clear documentation + starters, which are Gatsby sites that are
    preconfigured for different use cases to give you a head start for your
    project
  </p>
  <p>Built with performance and accessibility in mind</p>
  <p>
    (no more clicks) So, assuming we've set up a Gatsby site, what do we do with
    it?
  </p>
  <p>
    The Jamstack architecture would tell us that we want to host it statically,
    right? That's where Netlify comes in...
  </p>

# Why Netlify?

A ‚Äústatic site‚Äù host leveraging all the benefits of the Jamstack, plus:

<ul>

    <li>‚úÖ Automated builds via Git</li>
    <li>üòÖ Atomic deploys with one-click rollback</li>
    <li>üåê Custom domains</li>

    <li>‚öôÔ∏è Simple setup</li>
    <li>üÜì Free starter team</li>
  </Appear>
</ul>

<Notes>
  <p>Netlify helps you build and manage Jamstack projects.</p>
  <p>
    It offers automated builds with continous deployment from your Git provider
  </p>
  <p>Configure Netlify to build + deploy when you push to git</p>
  <p>
    Set up webhooks to trigger deploys based on an action elsewhere (e.g.,
    content update in Contentful)
  </p>
  <hr />
  <p>Netlify's deploys are atomic = versions your content by fingerprinting</p>
  <p>
    Instead of pushing individual files (FTP), Netlify creates new deploy object
  </p>
  <p>
    Compares new deploy with existing deploy and determines what files have
    changed
  </p>
  <p>
    Allows for one-click rollback - so you can make an older deploy live
    instantly
  </p>
  <hr />
  <p>
    Netlify sites come with their own customizable URL, your-site.netlify.com
  </p>
  <p>Or buy a custom domain through Netlify or another domain provider</p>
  <hr />
  <p>Free HTTPS comes out of the box</p>
  <hr />
  <p>Simple setup</p>
  <p>
    Free team with flexible pricing tiers and add-ons if you need more team
    members, bandwidth, guaranteed support, etc

    So, now that we're familiar with the tools we're going to use, let's get

    store form responses in Netlify

</div>

<Notes>
  <p>
    To start, we would open up the terminal and install the Gatsby command line
    tools. These will help us to build and run a Gatsby site locally
  </p>
  <p>
    Then, we'll creaate a project called 'portfolio' from a "Gatsby Starter" theme called gatsby-starter-forty
  </p>
  <p>
    We'll change directories into the portfolio folder we created on the last step, and then run gatsby develop to run the project locally on our machine
  </p>
  <p>Now, let's see what our local Gatsby starter looks like! The terminal will give us a local URL like localhost:8000 we can visit</p>

<Notes>
  <p>This is a pretty slick looking starter</p>
  <p>
    We're going to focus in on this existing contact form, and hook it up to
    capture leads from people who visit our site
  </p>
  <p>
    To do that, we'll want to open up our favorite code editor and bring up the
    Gatsby code in the portfolio directory we just created
  </p>

<Notes>
  <p>
    Open the Contact.js file of the Gatsby starter so we can hook it up to
    Netlify
  </p>
  <p>
    Once the site is deployed, Netlify's post-processing bots are going to look
    for `netlify` attributes on the form in order to capture it
  </p>
  <p>
    These bots only know how to parse HTML, so we have to give them a little
    help to make sure they can detect forms rendered with Javascript (walk
    through code)
  </p>
  <p>
    Now our site is ready to be deployed. Before we do that, let's make sure
    we've hooked our local code up to a GitHub repository

<Notes>
  <p>Let's open our terminal again and initalize git (walk through code)</p>
  <p>
    The last step is deploy our code from GitHub to the web with Netlify so we
    can set up and test our form

<Notes>
  <p>Visit app.netlify.com and create an account or log in</p>
  <p>Click "New site from Git"</p>
  <p>Connect to GitHub</p>
  <p>Select the repo we just created</p>
  <p>Netlify guesses our build settings</p>
  <p>Deploy your site!</p>
  <p>
    If you prefer using the command line, Netlify also offers a command line
    tool to link and deploy sites

# Try it live

<a href="https://netlify-gatsby-form-example.netlify.com/" target="_blank">https://netlify-gatsby-form-example.netlify.com/</a>

<ul>
  <li>Visit app.netlify.com, find the site, and click "Forms" to see and manage form entries</li>
  <li>
    Set up form notifications with Netlify or a{" "}
    <a

    >
      Zapier integration
    </a>{" "}
  </li>
</ul>

<Notes>
  <p>
    Now we can test the form live on our Netlify site by visiting
    https://netlify-gatsby-form-example.netlify.com/
  </p>
  <p>Fill out the form if you want</p>
  <p>To see form responses, we can visit the Netlify dashboard</p>
  <p>Netlify is essentially acting as our database to hold the form entries</p>
  <p>
    You can also set up email notifications so you know when a user submits your
    form
  </p>
  <p>Let's try it out!</p>
</Notes>

export default LayoutDark;

<Image
  src={require("file-loader!./images/fill-out-form.gif")}
  size="90% auto"
/>

<Notes>
  <p>First, we'll visit the site that we deployed on Netlify</p>
  <p>And now we're going to try filling out our form</p>
  <p>Success! Let's make sure Netlify captured our form entry</p>
</Notes>

---

export default LayoutDark;

<Image
  src={require("file-loader!./images/check-form-submission.gif")}
  size="90% auto"
/>

<Notes>
  <p>We would want to visit our Netlify dashboard</p>
  <p>Click into the site and then go to "Forms"</p>
  <p>There's our form, with the name we set earlier</p>
  <p>And there's our entry!</p>
  <p>
    If this site had been live for a while, we could also use this toggle to see
    any spam entries that Netlify filtered out for us
  </p>

# The <span className="highlight">Jam</span>stack difference

<ul>
  <li>‚ö°Ô∏è Blazing fast performance</li>
  <li>ü§ë Cheaper + easier scaling</li>
  <li>üö® Fewer security risks</li>
  <li>üë©üèª‚Äçüíª Better developer experience</li>
  <li>‚ú® Give  developers superpowers</li>
</ul>

<Notes>
  <p>So why does all this matter again?</p>
  <p>We just spun up a portfolio site with a working contact form with zero backend code and no database, in about 5 minutes!!</p>
  <p>Netlify and Gatsby gave us tools to do this quickly and efficiently, using just our terminal and a bit of HTML</p>
  <p>Jamstack doesn't mean you're stuck with a "static," unchanging site</p>
  <p>
    It means you're choosing all of the advantages I mentioned - performance, scaling, a
    better dev experience - by choosing a static architecture and deciding to
    host statically
  </p>
  <p>
